  <h2>Kayangan Lake</h2>
  <p>
	Kayangan Lake is a crystal-clear freshwater lake in Coron, featuring underwater 
	rock formations, caves and islets. It’s a popular spot for photographers, for fairly 
	obvious reasons, and is said to be the cleanest lake in all of the Philippines. 
	The water is so clear that you can often see down to a depth of 10 metres, enabling even 
	non-swimmers to see the untouched rock formations from viewpoints around the lake.

  <h2>Barracuda Lake</h2>
  <p>
    Barracuda Lake, situated on the north shore of Coron Island in the Philippines, 
	offers one of the most unique diving experiences in the world. Occasionally referred 
	to as Luluyuan Lake by locals, its crystal blue waters hidden between majestic rocky 
	formations aren’t big on actual barracudas and other wildlife. 
	Instead, divers can experience a thermocline and halocline unlike anywhere else.

  <h2>Twin Lagoon</h2>
  <p>
    Twin Lagoons is one of the best places to visit in Coron. 
	It’s one of the many spectacular destinations visited on 
	island hopping trips here, but even amongst the many hidden lakes, 
	lagoons and beaches that Coron is famous for, Twin Lagoon will always 
	stand out among the best of the best. 
	It’s beautiful, and it’s an adventure.

  <h2>Malcapuya</h2>
  <p>
	If you are looking for a completely remote and undeveloped island escape,
	you have to visit Malcapuya Island.
	Malcapuya Island is one of the most idyllic islands near Coron and one of 
	the best island hopping tours you can take from Coron.
	This small destination is sparsely populated, offering visitors an 
	unbeatable tropical experience! Malcapuya Island is closely located 
	next to Banana Island and Bulog Dos.

  <h2>Ditaytayan</h2>
  <p>
	Ditaytayan Island is one of the most emblematic spot in the beautiful region 
	of Culion, Palawan. With its white sandbar, which gets covered at high tide, 
	it offers a truly splendid view. The best snorkeling spots are located on both
	sides of the sandbar. This small island also has three beaches on its other sides, 
	including the locally famous “Long Beach”. This truly stunning and relaxing place can be 
	visited while taking an island hopping tour from Coron or on an expedition coming from 
	or going to El Nido.

  <h2>Black Island</h2>
  <p>
	In a sea of rounded peaks, Black Island is the odd man in these freckled
	waters of Busuanga. Odd man, yes, but not out. 
	Its toothed tops and heavily contoured walls are 
	not inviting but imposing, not nurturing but overpowering
